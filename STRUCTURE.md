## Repository Structure (managed)

High-level boundaries generated by `caad docs` to reduce drift.

- `backend/` — legacy Go backend and refinement helpers (not used in Phases 0–2)
- `contracts/` — JSON schemas that define call artifacts and AI outputs
- `docker/` — Docker helper assets referenced by the Dockerfile
- `models/` — LocalAI model configs and binaries (binaries gitignored)
- `runtime/` — generated artifacts and call records (gitignored)
- `scripts/` — local helper scripts (dev reset, smoke)
- `skills/` — repo-local skillkit and CLI (`caad`) for AI, env, ops, and docs
- `worker/` — file-based ingestion worker (polling watcher + pipeline)

For details, see the boundary README files generated per directory.
